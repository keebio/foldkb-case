# FoldKB Case

## Info about the different directories in this repository

### [`plates`](plates)

These are the plate files used to produce 1.5/1.6mm thick plates that are in-stock on [Keebio](https://keeb.io).

### [`enclosed-case`](enclosed-case)

This contains STL files for a 3D-printed case that goes around 1.6mm thick plates that are sold.

To assemble the full case with the prints, you will need [18mm M2 screws](https://keeb.io/products/m2-screws-and-standoffs?variant=39405256147038) that will be inserted from the bottom case, by going through the bottom plate, then mid layer, then switch plate, and then finally the top shell. Since you are threading directly into the 3D print without threaded inserts, do note that there may be a limited number of times you can screw/unscrew the top shell.

### [`acrylic`](acrylic)

This has a DXF file for having an acrylic middle layer made to go in between the switch plate and the bottom plate. This is the same as the one being sold at Keebio.

Additionally, there are two 3D-printable STL files that are the top shells that fit with the FR4 plates and this middle layer. As with the `enclosed-case` files, you will need [18mm M2 screws](https://keeb.io/products/m2-screws-and-standoffs?variant=39405256147038) to use with these top shells.
